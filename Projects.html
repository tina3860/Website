                    changes continue to affect how we operate and interact in business today. The trend towards remote
                    work was already underway, thanks
                    to the rise of telecommunications and freelance opportunities. However, the pandemic accelerated
                    this trend, resulting in the widespread adoption of working from home and its transformative effects
                    on
                    traditional work structures. The research objective is to give businesses seeking to implement a
                    remote/hybrid work policy indications on whether or not this type of policy would be appropriate and
                    successful by
                    providing businesses with actionable insights to inform their decision-making regarding remote work

                    ultimately fostering a more effective and sustainable work environment for both employers and
                    employees in the new norm of remote work.
