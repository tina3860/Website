                    work was already underway, thanks

                    traditional work structures. The research objective is to give businesses seeking to implement a

                    employees in the new norm of remote work.

                    The results show that when crafting a work-from-home policy, it is
                    important to focus on the needs of these demographics, as they make up the majority of the current
                    and upcoming workforce. Based on these findings, the recommendation is to focus on the needs of
                    the employees. “What is good for people is good for the organization” [7, p. 5]. It is suggested to
                    research policies other similar companies have established and then tailor them to your company’s
                    specific needs. The most important thing to do is to understand your employees by studying their
                    demographics and their needs. I utilized UCLA’s and Vanderbloemen’s, an executive search firm,

                <p class="section_descriptions"> Environmental Products & Accessories, LLC (EPA Sales) is a manufacturer
                    and reseller of vacuum truck parts. Despite its industry presence, EPA Sales currently lacks
                    outbound sales efforts, limiting its ability to anticipate customer needs and encourage repeat
                    purchases. This project aims to predict customer reorders and reorder timing while identifying
                    high-value customer segments to inform sales and marketing strategies.

                    Using historical 2024 transaction data, we applied K-Means Clustering to refine customer
                    segmentation based on purchasing behavior, Random Forest to determine feature importance and predict
                    if a customer will repurchase within 30 days, association rule mining to look for interesting and
                    useful relationships between items, and the Cox Proportional Hazards model to estimate the
                    likelihood and timing of future purchases.

                    We analyzed join-level customer, transaction, and product data to uncover purchase behaviors,
                    product performance patterns, and time-based trends. Using K-means clustering, we identified three
                    customer segments with distinct spend and frequency profiles; a random forest classifier (AUC > 95%)
                    effectively predicted 30-day reorders; association rule mining revealed complementary product
                    bundles; and a Cox proportional hazards model highlighted a critical repurchase window within 50
                    days. Our findings inform segmentation-driven marketing, inventory optimization, and early lifecycle
                    outreach strategies to boost retention and revenue.
