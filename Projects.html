                <p class="section_descriptions"> The occupational world changed after the 2019 COVID pandemic. These
                    changes continue to affect how we operate and interact in business today. The trend towards remote
                    work was already underway, thanks
                    to the rise of telecommunications and freelance opportunities. However, the pandemic accelerated
                    this trend, resulting in the widespread adoption of working from home and its transformative effects
                    on
                    traditional work structures. The research objective is to give businesses seeking to implement a
                    remote/hybrid work policy indications on whether or not this type of policy would be appropriate and
                    successful by
                    providing businesses with actionable insights to inform their decision-making regarding remote work
                    policies,
                    ultimately fostering a more effective and sustainable work environment for both employers and
                    employees in the new norm of remote work.

                    The results show that when crafting a work-from-home policy, it is
                    important to focus on the needs of these demographics, as they make up the majority of the current
                    and upcoming workforce. Based on these findings, the recommendation is to focus on the needs of
                    the employees. “What is good for people is good for the organization” [7, p. 5]. It is suggested to
                    research policies other similar companies have established and then tailor them to your company’s
                    specific needs. The most important thing to do is to understand your employees by studying their
                    demographics and their needs. I utilized UCLA’s and Vanderbloemen’s, an executive search firm,
                    guidelines for a remote working policy to recommend implementation.

                <p class="section_descriptions"> Environmental Products & Accessories, LLC (EPA Sales) is a manufacturer
                    and reseller of vacuum truck parts. Despite its industry presence, EPA Sales currently lacks
                    outbound sales efforts, limiting its ability to anticipate customer needs and encourage repeat
                    purchases. This project aims to predict customer reorders and reorder timing while identifying
                    high-value customer segments to inform sales and marketing strategies.

                    Using historical 2024 transaction data, we applied K-Means Clustering to refine customer
                    segmentation based on purchasing behavior, Random Forest to determine feature importance and predict
                    if a customer will repurchase within 30 days, association rule mining to look for interesting and
                    useful relationships between items, and the Cox Proportional Hazards model to estimate the
                    likelihood and timing of future purchases.

                    We analyzed join-level customer, transaction, and product data to uncover purchase behaviors,
                    product performance patterns, and time-based trends. Using K-means clustering, we identified three
                    customer segments with distinct spend and frequency profiles; a random forest classifier (AUC > 95%)
                    effectively predicted 30-day reorders; association rule mining revealed complementary product
                    bundles; and a Cox proportional hazards model highlighted a critical repurchase window within 50
                    days. Our findings inform segmentation-driven marketing, inventory optimization, and early lifecycle
                    outreach strategies to boost retention and revenue.

                <h1 class="section-title">Analyzing the Impact of Technology & Digital Media Consumption on The Human
                    Attention Span</h1>
                <p class="section_descriptions"> This project examines whether and how modern technology and digital
                    media consumption have impacted human attention spans, framing attention as three components:
                    direction (task switching), depth (level of immersion), and duration (sustained focus). The analysis
                    combines behavioral smartphone data with large-scale media datasets to evaluate how digital habits
                    and content formats align with changing attention patterns.

                    Using datasets from Lancaster University and Kaggle, the project analyzes smartphone usage (device
                    checks, screen time, age cohorts), music trends (Spotify song durations and popularity from
                    1956–2019), and video platforms (YouTube trending videos and TikTok engagement data). Data
                    preparation included cleaning inconsistent fields, standardizing durations, removing invalid
                    records, creating age cohorts, and normalizing engagement metrics to enable fair cross-platform
                    comparisons.

                    Key findings show that younger users (18–25) engage with their phones more frequently, with distinct
                    patterns: ages 18–20 check devices often for short bursts, while ages 21–25 engage in longer
                    sessions. Screen time follows a trimodal distribution, suggesting light, moderate, and heavy user
                    types. Media analysis indicates a long-term shift toward shorter, more concise content: popular
                    songs have shortened since the early 2000s, and high-popularity tracks cluster between 2–5 minutes.
                    On video platforms, TikTok drives rapid, high-like engagement through short-form content, while
                    YouTube supports deeper engagement via longer videos and higher comment activity, particularly for
                    educational or searchable content.

                    Overall, the project concludes that digital platforms increasingly favor short-form, high-energy
                    content optimized for quick engagement, reinforcing frequent attention switching and reduced
                    sustained focus. While content length alone does not determine engagement, platform design strongly
                    shapes how attention is captured and expressed. The findings highlight the importance of mindful
                    media consumption and provide evidence-based insight into how technology both responds to and
                    reinforces shrinking attention spans.

                <h1 class="section-title">Creating a Database</h1>
                <p class="section_descriptions"> This project involved designing and building a centralized product
                    inventory management database for Environmental Products & Accessories (EPA), a small manufacturer
                    and reseller of vacuum truck and hydro-excavation equipment. The core problem was fragmented, poorly
                    integrated data across Shopify, Sage, and HubSpot, which caused inconsistent inventory records, weak
                    visibility into stock levels, and operational inefficiencies. Rather than attempting to clean legacy
                    systems, the project intentionally started from scratch to design a clean, scalable database aligned
                    to business needs.

                    The solution was a relational SQL database structured around five core entities: Product, Supplier,
                    Category, Inventory, and Sales (with Transactions separated for normalization). An ER diagram and
                    relational schema were created to enforce data integrity and clearly define one-to-many and
                    one-to-one relationships across departments. This design supports key operational use cases
                    including real-time inventory tracking, supplier management, sales analysis, and reorder monitoring
                    for purchasing and warehouse teams.

                        alt="Person working from home at a desk with a laptop, on a video call, with a dog nearby and clothes hanging in the background. Messages and icons float around, showing online communication.">
                    The database was implemented using SQL, including table creation with primary and foreign keys, data
                    type enforcement, and sample data inserts. Analytical queries were written to answer realistic
                    business questions such as identifying products sold after a specific date, detecting items below
                    reorder levels, ranking top revenue-generating products, and calculating category- and
                    supplier-based revenue. These queries demonstrate how stakeholders would use the system for
                    reporting and decision-making.

                    Overall, the project highlights strong fundamentals in database design, normalization, and applied
                    SQL analytics. The key takeaway is that thoughtful upfront data modeling prevents downstream
                    inefficiencies. By consolidating inventory, sales, and supplier data into a single source of truth,
                    the proposed system improves accuracy, reduces operational friction, and provides a scalable
                    foundation for future integrations and growth at EPA.

                <h1 class="section-title">Academic Risk Detection</h1>
                <p class="section_descriptions"> This project focused on developing a data-driven framework to
                    proactively identify high school students who are academically at risk before failure occurs. The
                    core problem addressed was the lack of scalable, early-warning systems in schools, where
                    interventions often happen only after performance has already declined. The goal was to surface risk
                    factors early so that students, families, educators, and administrators can take targeted action to
                    improve engagement, retention, and academic outcomes.

                    The solution combined exploratory data analysis with predictive and unsupervised machine learning
                    models using a synthetic high-school dataset of 2,392 students. The data captured demographics,
                    academic behavior, parental involvement, tutoring, absences, study habits, and extracurricular
                    participation. Age was mapped to grade level as a proxy, categorical variables were encoded for
                    modeling, and GPA thresholds were used to define academic risk. Exploratory analysis revealed clear
                    patterns linking absences, parental support, and extracurricular engagement to academic performance,
                    while showing minimal performance differences by gender.

                        alt="Person working from home at a desk with a laptop, on a video call, with a dog nearby and clothes hanging in the background. Messages and icons float around, showing online communication.">

                    Multiple modeling approaches were implemented to both predict outcomes and understand drivers of
                    risk. A linear regression model was used to predict GPA and identify statistically significant
                    predictors, achieving strong explanatory power and demonstrating that absences, parental support,
                    tutoring, and study time were among the most influential factors. A decision tree classifier was
                    then used to predict grade classification, reinforcing attendance as the most critical early-warning
                    signal while highlighting limitations related to class imbalance. K-means clustering was applied to
                    segment students into distinct behavioral profiles, revealing groups such as high-effort but
                    low-performance students and low-engagement, high-risk students—insights that go beyond simple
                    pass/fail labels.

                    Overall, the project demonstrates how combining predictive modeling with clustering can support
                    early intervention strategies in education. The key takeaway is that academic risk is multifaceted
                    and cannot be addressed through grades alone. By identifying attendance patterns, support
                    structures, and engagement behaviors, this framework provides a practical foundation for
                    early-warning dashboards, targeted tutoring programs, and policy decisions that shift schools from
                    reactive remediation to proactive student support.
